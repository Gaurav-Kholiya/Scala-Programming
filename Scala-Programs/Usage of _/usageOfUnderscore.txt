  2. case _ =>         			:// Wild card pattern -- matches anything  
  3.f(xs: _*)         			:// Sequence xs is passed as multiple parameters to f(ys: T*)
  4.m(_)              			:// Partial function application
  5._ + _             			:// Anonymous function placeholder parameter
  6.m _               			:// Expansion of method into method value
  7.import scala.{ Predef => _, _ }	:// Exclusion, everything except Predef
  8.case Seq(xs @ _*) 		:// Identifier xs is bound to the whole matched sequence
  9.def f[M[_]]       			:// Higher kinded type parameter
